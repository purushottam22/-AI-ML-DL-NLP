# AI/ML/DL/NLP
I am working on different ML, Deep learning, computer vision and other projects. Those projects will be here.

I am actively engaged in various projects encompassing AI, ML, DL, and NLP. Notable projects include an autoencoder implementation, a chatbot with object detection and speech recognition capabilities, and a computer vision project integrating pretrained VGG-16 model, face detection, face mesh calculation, hand tracking, pose estimation, and volume control using hand gestures. Additionally, I am working on time series forecasting (pending publication), NLP projects, and analysis of hospital datasets related to leg fractures.
